```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1 Basics Objects

## 1.1 Vectors and matrices

```{r}
  vec <- seq(1:5)
  vec[1:3]
```

















```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
